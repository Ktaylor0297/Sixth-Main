    <p>George Petry Drugstore</p>

    <p>Early on, the building housed the Geo. Petry Drugstore. The back part of the building, along Sixth Street, was originally three stories. Only two were rebuilt after a fire in the early part of the 20th Century. The original entrance was on the corner of the building, and the metal frame for the awning is visible.</p>

    <p>Logan's Drugstore</p>

    <p>In this picture, the entrance has been moved to the center of the Main Street face of the building, and Crane's Barber Shop is next door.</p>

    <p>Interurban Rail Line</p>
    <img src="rail.jpg" alt="Historical photo of downtown Shelbyville">
    <p>From 1910 until some time in the 1930's, an interurban electric rail line connected downtown Shelbyville along US60 with downtown Louisville. The line was apparently a source of great contention from the start. A great history of the line is available on the Kentucky Explorer web site. In this photo, the rail lines are clearly visible down the middle of Main Street.</p>
